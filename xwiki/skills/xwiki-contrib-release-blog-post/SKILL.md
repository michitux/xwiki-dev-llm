description: Announce an xwiki-contrib extension release by creating the "<Extension> Extension <version> Released" blog post on the xwiki.org Blog, following the contrib release-documentation convention (page name, title, content/summary templates, categories, publish date). Use after releasing an xwiki-contrib extension (groupId org.xwiki.contrib) when the blog-post step of the release documentation still needs doing (the release itself is xwiki-contrib-release). This is for contributed extensions only — not core xwiki-platform releases; for the release notes and issue documentation of a core release use xwiki-release-documentation. For writing/reviewing general documentation pages use xwiki-doc-writing instead; for deploying a XAR/JAR to a running instance use xwiki-deploy-extension.

# Announce an xwiki-contrib extension release on the xwiki.org Blog

This skill creates the release-announcement blog post on the **xwiki.org Blog** for an
**xwiki-contrib** extension (the "Documentation" step of releasing a contrib project). It applies to
contributed extensions published under the `org.xwiki.contrib` Maven groupId and listed on the
Extensions wiki — not to core xwiki-platform releases, which have their own release-notes process.

The authoritative source of truth is the **Release → Documentation** section of the contrib guide:
https://contrib.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome#HDocumentation — when a detail here is
unclear or looks outdated, consult that page and prefer it. The templates below already incorporate
one fix the live guide was missing (the per-version page link, see step 3).

Browser mechanics (open/snapshot/fill/click) are handled by the **agent-browser** skill — load it
for the how-to of driving Chrome; this skill covers only the XWiki-specific content and the gotchas.

## 1. Gather the release facts

From the extension page on the Extensions wiki (e.g.
`https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/<ExtensionSpace>/`) collect:

- **Extension name** — the human title (e.g. "Wiki Link URL Normalizer").
- **Extension space path** — the nested path after `Extension/` in the URL (usually a single
  segment, e.g. `WikiLinkURLNormalizer`). Used to build the reference
  `extensions:Extension.<space path>.WebHome`.
- **Extension type** — shown in the extension's metadata on the page. Most extensions are type
  "Extension" or "Application"; some multi-module projects are type **"Project"**. The templates
  of step 3 are the same for both. The type only decides which page you announce:
  - **Announce the top-level Project page, not a child module page.** A multi-module Project (e.g.
    `Extension/Documentation/`, type "Project") aggregates child pages such as
    `Extension/Documentation/DocumentationApplication/` (type "Application/XAR"). The release
    announcement targets the **top-level Project** page — its space path is the single segment
    (`Documentation`), and the child pages are *not* what you link to. Confirm the type on the page
    you intend to announce; if it says "Application"/"XAR" but sits under a "Project", step up to the
    parent.
- **Released version** and **release date**.
- **What changed** in this version: each version, of a Project as well as of an
  Extension/Application, has a dedicated page at
  `https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/<ExtensionSpace>/Versions/<version>/`
  (reference `extensions:Extension.<space path>.Versions.<version>.WebHome`), the one linked from the
  Version column of the page's Versions table. Its release notes (the JIRA issues of the fix
  version, or the OpenProject work packages copied there at release time) are the basis for the
  release text and any minimal-version change. Complete them with the git log
  (`git log --oneline <prev-tag>..<release-tag>`) when a note is too terse to explain the change.

## 2. Page name and title

- **Title:** `<Extension name> Extension <version> Released` — e.g.
  `Wiki Link URL Normalizer Extension 1.10.0 Released`.
- **Page name:** lowercase kebab-case `<extension>-extension-<version>-released`, with the version
  **kept as is, dots included** — the contrib guide's own example is `blog-extension-1.5-released`,
  so `documentation-extension-1.15-released`, never `…-1-15-released`. The Blog quick-add form turns
  spaces **and dots** into dashes and keeps the original case, so it produces a capitalized name like
  `Wiki-Link-URL-Normalizer-Extension-1-10-0-Released` — **not** what we want.
  Instead create the page with a controlled name by opening the edit URL directly (nested page,
  matching recent posts such as `guided-tour-extension-0-1-released`):

  ```
  https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/Blog/<page-name>/WebHome?template=Blog.BlogPostTemplate&parent=Blog.WebHome&title=<URL-encoded title>&Blog.BlogPostClass_0_title=<URL-encoded title>
  ```

  with `<page-name>` = `wiki-link-url-normalizer-extension-1.10.0-released` (lowercase, dots kept). In
  the URL the dots stay plain; in a wiki *reference* to the page they are escaped
  (`Blog.wiki-link-url-normalizer-extension-1\.10\.0-released.WebHome`).

## 3. Content and summary templates (XWiki 2.1 syntax)

The post's text + metadata live in a `Blog.BlogPostClass` xobject. Fill **both** the content and the
summary/extract fields.

**Present the changes as a bullet list** in the *content* field (one `*` bullet per change — bug fix,
feature, or minimal-version bump), following the intro sentence. The *summary/extract* field stays a
single flowing sentence — no bullet list there.

The version link points to the **dedicated version page** (the older guide pointed it at a
no-longer-existing `anchor="H<version>"` on the extension homepage). This holds for a Project too:
its Versions section is a Live Data table with no per-version heading, so a `#H<version>` anchor
lands nowhere.

**Content:**

```
The [[<extension name>>>doc:extensions:Extension.<space path>.WebHome]] [[<version>>>doc:extensions:Extension.<space path>.Versions.<version>.WebHome]] has been released.

This release brings the following changes:

* <change 1>
* <change 2>
* <...one bullet per change; last one is the minimal-version bump if any>
```

**Summary / extract:**

```
The [[<extension name>>>doc:extensions:Extension.<space path>.WebHome]] [[<version>>>doc:extensions:Extension.<space path>.Versions.<version>.WebHome]] has been released. <one-sentence description>
```

**Escape the dots in `<version>`** — `.` is the entity separator in XWiki references, so version
`1.10.0` must be written `1\.10\.0`. Example version link:

```
[[1.10.0>>doc:extensions:Extension.WikiLinkURLNormalizer.Versions.1\.10\.0.WebHome]]
```

`extensions:` is the cross-wiki prefix (the Blog is on the `xwiki` wiki, versions on the
`extensions` wiki — same farm, so `doc:` references resolve).

When the extension's name reads awkwardly on its own, add the word "extension" after the link —
e.g. `The [[Documentation>>doc:extensions:Extension.Documentation.WebHome]] extension
[[1.15>>doc:extensions:Extension.Documentation.Versions.1\.15.WebHome]] has been released.`

## 4. Categories

Tick **all six** (these also push the announcement to the "What's New" feed of every XWiki instance):

- `Releases`
- `Extensions`
- `Contrib`
- `What's New for XWiki`
- `What's New for XWiki: Admin User`
- `What's New for XWiki: Extension`

## 5. Publish and date

- Check the **Publish** checkbox (so it publishes when saved).
- Set **Publish date** to the actual release date (form format `dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss`), unless the
  user wants the posting date.

## 6. Create it in the browser

Use the **agent-browser** skill. Key gotchas learned the hard way:

- **Login required.** Creating a blog post needs an authenticated xwiki.org account with blog-post
  permissions. If not logged in, have the user log in in the visible window.
- **agent-browser launches headless (invisible) by default.** If the user needs to see the page /
  click Save themselves, launch a **visible** window: `agent-browser --headed --session <name>
  open …`. A pre-existing headless daemon for the default session will ignore `--headed`, so use a
  fresh `--session` (and `close --all` / kill stragglers if needed). Transfer an existing login into
  the new session with `state save <file>` from the logged-in session then `--state <file>` on the
  headed launch.
- **Enter wiki syntax via Source mode.** The content and summary fields are CKEditor; click each
  field's **"Source"** button, then `fill` the resulting textarea with the wiki-syntax template.
  Driving it with JavaScript instead (e.g. claude-in-chrome, in the developer's logged-in browser):
  the switch to Source is **asynchronous** (a server-side conversion), and it wipes any data set
  before it completes, even from `setMode('source', callback)`. Switch first, wait until
  `CKEDITOR.instances[…].mode === 'source'`, then set the value of the editor's `textarea.cke_source`
  and dispatch an `input` event. Check `getData()` and look at the field: it must show the text.
- **Never write a macro name with its braces in the text.** A literal `{{image}}` (or any
  `{{macro}}`) in the content is *executed* by the renderer at Preview — e.g. `{{image}}` fails with
  `Failed to execute the [image] macro. Cause: [Parameter [reference] is mandatory]` and shows as a
  `.xwikirenderingerror`. Refer to macros in prose ("the image macro"), not as `{{image}}`.
- **Fill from a file to avoid shell quote-mangling.** Content with double quotes (e.g. a `"How-to"`
  label) gets mangled if passed inline through the shell. Write the wiki syntax to a temp file and
  fill with `agent-browser … fill @ref "$(cat file.txt)"` — command substitution keeps quotes literal.
- **Re-fill the Source textarea after any Preview round-trip.** Clicking **"Back To Edit"** re-renders
  the fields as WYSIWYG; if the content had macro-like text the WYSIWYG round-trip can corrupt it. On
  returning to edit, re-click "Source" and re-`fill` both fields from the files before re-previewing.
  Category/Publish/date state does survive the round-trip; only the CKEditor content needs re-filling.
- Check the 6 category checkboxes, the Publish checkbox, and set the publish date.

## 7. Verify, then hand off

- Use the editor's **Preview** to confirm the links resolve and there are **no rendering errors**
  (`.xwikirenderingerror`). Click **"Back To Edit"** to return.
  - Verify the version link `href` points to `…/Extension/<ExtensionSpace>/Versions/<version>/`.
  - Also confirm the changes render as a proper bullet list and the summary as a single sentence.
- **Do not Save unless asked.** The default is to leave the form fully filled and let the user
  review and press **Save** / **Save & View** themselves. Save automatically only when the user
  explicitly tells you to.

## Worked example (Wiki Link URL Normalizer 1.10.0)

- Title: `Wiki Link URL Normalizer Extension 1.10.0 Released`
- Page: `Blog.wiki-link-url-normalizer-extension-1.10.0-released`
- Content:
  ```
  The [[Wiki Link URL Normalizer>>doc:extensions:Extension.WikiLinkURLNormalizer.WebHome]] [[1.10.0>>doc:extensions:Extension.WikiLinkURLNormalizer.Versions.1\.10\.0.WebHome]] has been released.

  This release brings the following changes:

  * Adds support for normalizing local URLs that contain anchors (URL fragments)
  * Raises the minimal supported XWiki version to 15.10
  ```
- Categories: the six in step 4. Publish: on. Date: `11/06/2026 12:00:00`.
- A **Project** type works the same way: the Documentation project 1.15 announcement links
  `[[1.15>>doc:extensions:Extension.Documentation.Versions.1\.15.WebHome]]`.
